# Saving Superstore Project

In this project I am worked as a consultant for a supermarket chain that is on the verge of bankruptcy. I was tasked with performing exploratory data analysis of the provided dataset to find ways to increase profitabililty and avoid bankruptcy. 

After performing exploratory data anlysis of the dataset, I built visuals and charts to identify trends and areas that could be improved to help overall profitability. The main focus was on the biggest profit makers and biggest losers, advertising, and product returns.
