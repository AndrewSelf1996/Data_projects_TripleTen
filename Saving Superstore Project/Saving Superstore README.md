# Saving Superstore Project

In this project I worked as a consultant for a supermarket chain on the verge of bankruptcy. I was tasked with performing exploratory data analysis of the provided dataset to find ways to increase profitabililty and avoid bankruptcy. 

After performing exploratory data analysis of the dataset, I built visuals and charts to identify trends and areas that could be improved to help overall profitability. The main focus was on the biggest profit makers and biggest losers, advertising, and product returns. I created a presentation to showcase findings and offer recommendations.

Recommended focusing on subcategories of copiers, phones, and accessories as these were the most profitable. Additionally recommended expanding business in Vermont due to the combination of the high profit rate and low return rate on products sold in the state.
