# Zomato Customer Analysis Segmentation Project

In this project I was asked to perform a customer segmentation analysis for Zomato, a restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. 

I cleaned the raw dataset to remove any fields unrelated to my analysis and segmented customers into different categories based on factors such as age, gender, and employment status. After analyzing and segmenting Zomato's customer base, I examined their purchasing behaviors to identify strengths and weaknesses in company revenues. Finally, I made recommendations of action items for Zomato to improve sales in months that statistically generate lower total revenues and to increase revenues in certain customer segments. 

Recommended that Zomato put an emphasis on students as these are the largest demographic in their customer base, and offer discounts during back to school season such as free delivery to reduce the drop in sales during the month of September when school is going back in session.
