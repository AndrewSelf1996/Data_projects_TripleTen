# Storytelling with Data Project

In this project I was tasked with performing exploratory data analysis of product returns for a superstore chain. In this analysis I built visuals to discover root causes and factors affecting return levels. I then made recommendations for the chain going forward to help lower return rates and overall return levels. 

I built a Tableau story and dashboards and presented my findings via a video recording. I discussed correlations discovered and recommendations for the company going forward to lower product return levels based on different factors such as geographic location, product category and subcategory.

Recommended offering free second-class shipping to western states in the U.S. due to higher return volumes in these states and lower return rates on this ship mode. Additionally recommended running a promotion on products in the labels and envelopes subcategories during December. These subcategories were the least-returned and had an increase in sales during December annually.
