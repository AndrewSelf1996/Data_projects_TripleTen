# Storytelling with Data Project

In this project I was tasked with performing exploratory data analysis of product returns for a superstore chain. In this analysis I built visuals to discover root causes and factors affecting return levels. I then made recommendations for the chain going forward to help lower return rates and overall return levels. 

I built a Tableau story and dashboards and presented my findings via a video recording. I discussed correlations discovered and recommendations for the company going forward to lower product return levels based on different factors such as geographic location, product category and subcategory.
