# TripleTen Code Pudding Project

For this project my team was tasked with creating a visual essay from the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset.

We cleaned the raw dataset to remove any outliers, duplicates, or missing data from the dataset and then performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset. We conducted this EDA seperately and then met back together to determine what insights were gained by each team member. Following this meeting, we used the visualizations created to create a story from the dataset in Tableau. 

Our story focused on the correlations between stress levels, sleep duration, and sleep quality as well as which occupations had the highest and lowest averages in these categories. We presented our findings to individuals looking to change careers to inform them of the possible effects on their sleep and stress levels that are associated with different occupations.
