# E-Commerce Project

In this project I was tasked with taking raw transaction data from the provided dataset and perfomring exploratory data analysis. 

I used data from the raw daatset to create a pivot table to represent the conversion funnel of the site. 

I used multiple formulas and created new columns in the dataset to find first purchase dates to form the cohorts. I then built acquisition cohorts and performed cohort analysis after filtering data to only include data from purchase events. 

Finally, I created another pivot table to calculate the retention rates of each cohort divided by first purchase month.

I also provided insight into why I filtered and used the data that I did and insights that were gathered following my analysis.
