# NYC Airbnb Project

This project involved taking raw Airbnb data of the Manhattan Borough of New York City and performing data analysis to recommend most profitable Airbnb rentals in the area. 

For the analysis of this project I utilized Google Sheets where I filtered relevant data, built pivot tables and used different functions to discover most profitable opportunities. I used these items to analyze property types to target, calculate unit occupancy rates and estimate future revenue. I then presented findings and offered recommendations to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner using an executive summary.

Recommended homes with 2 bedrooms or less and multiple neighborhoods that had the highest occupancy levels based on total reviews, such as Chelsea, East Harlem and East Village.
