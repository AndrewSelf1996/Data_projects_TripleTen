**Zuber Ride-Sharing Data Analysis**

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analytical case study conducted for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago. The goal of the analysis was to uncover patterns in passenger preferences and evaluate the impact of external factors, particularly weather, on ride frequency.

**Project Overview:**
As part of the analysis, I worked with a database containing detailed information on taxi rides, neighborhoods, and weather conditions in Chicago. Key tasks included:

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Analyzed the number of taxi rides by company for specific dates.
Compared ride frequencies for companies with names containing "Yellow" or "Blue."
Evaluated the popularity of top taxi companies and categorized others as "Other."

**Hypothesis Testing:**
Investigated how ride duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport varied on rainy Saturdays compared to other conditions.

**Data Used:**
The analysis was based on the following data tables:

Neighborhoods: Data on city neighborhoods. <br />
Cabs: Data on taxi vehicles and companies. <br />
Trips: Detailed ride information, including start/end times, distance, and location. <br />
Weather Records: Hourly weather data, including temperature and conditions.

**Key Insights:**
The analysis provided valuable insights into the relationship between weather conditions and ride duration, as well as company-specific ride preferences.
